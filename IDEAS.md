FUTURE IDEAS
------------

* Implement the memory store as an LRU cache instead of a finite-time buffer
* In Backbone.js plunk model, implement changes as a separate object
* Factor out importer scripts into separate directory and allow these to be pluggable (e.g.: gist importer, jsfiddle importer, etc..)
